Extension for managigng Food For Good site content.

== Known issues

- Asciidoctor may rely on Node environment,
  and may not work in browser
- Dark mode is not supported yet

Note that TS can throw errors about Buffer type during build,
this is becuase Asciidoctor library relies on NodeJS apparently.

However, this doesn’t cause issues considering the scope of extension’s functionality.
